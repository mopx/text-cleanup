- Repository: [github.com/mopx/text-cleanup](https://github.com/mopx/text-cleanup)

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (for development server)
- npm or Yarn package manager

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mopx/text-cleanup.git
cd text-cleanup
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using Yarn
yarn install
```

### Running in Development Mode

#### Primary Method: Using the dev script
```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using Yarn
yarn dev
```

This starts a Node.js http-server on `http://localhost:3000` and automatically opens your browser.

#### Alternative: Using Vercel Dev (if not in Vercel environment)
```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev:vercel

# Using Yarn
yarn dev:vercel
```

Note: If you get a "recursive invocation" error, it means you're already in a Vercel environment. Use the primary method above instead.

#### Manual Server Options

#### Recommended: Node.js http-server
```bash
# Install globally first
# With npm: npm install -g http-server
# With Yarn: yarn global add http-server

# Run the server
http-server -p 8000
```

#### VS Code Live Server (Recommended for VS Code users)
```bash
# Install the Live Server extension in VS Code
# Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server"
```

#### Alternative: Python (optional)
```bash
# Using Python 3 (if available)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Using Python 2 (if available)
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

## Production Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

#### Method 1: Using Vercel CLI
1. Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
# Using npm
npm install -g vercel

# Using Yarn
yarn global add vercel
```

2. Deploy:
```bash
vercel
```

Follow the prompts to configure your deployment.

#### Method 2: Using Git Integration
1. Connect your repository to Vercel at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Vercel will automatically build and deploy your app
4. Any pushes to the main branch will trigger automatic redeployments

### Deploy to Other Platforms

#### Netlify
1. Connect your repository to Netlify at [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Set build settings:
   - Build command: (leave empty or use `echo 'No build required'`)
   - Publish directory: `/` (root directory)

#### GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to Pages section
3. Select source branch (usually `main`)
4. Your app will be available at `https://username.github.io/text-cleanup`

#### Manual Deployment
Since this is a static site, you can deploy it to any web server:
1. Upload `index.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`, and any other assets to your web server
2. Ensure the server can serve static files
3. Access your domain to view the app
